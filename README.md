- Hi,👋 I’m Anesu Mazvimavi!. I'm a flutter developer. I'm naturally a visual artist specialising in painting, drawing and design. I further took up my artistic abilities and combined them with programming and then became a developer. The abilities of programming and design have made me a good problem solver (I think!!!!) 😁

- 👀 I’m interested in coding and designing
- 🌱 I’m currently learning mostly Flutter but open minded to other frameworks
- 💞️ I’m looking for a remote full time flutter developer job 😅
- 📫 How to reach me: Email or Instagram
- ⚡ Fun fact: Arsenal Football Club is my first love ♥
